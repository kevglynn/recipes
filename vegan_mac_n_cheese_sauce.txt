Vegan Cheese Sauce - for Vegan Mac & Cheese or a Vegan Cheese Fondue

This is a very simple recipe that makes use of Daiya's vegan cheeses. I recommend using the chedder. Either the block or sliced style is fine.

	Ingredients:
		1/2 block Daiya cheese (or 4-5 slices)
		1/2 cup coconut milk
		2 tblsp nutritional yeast flakes


	Instructions:
		Over medium heat, melt and mix all ingredients with a whisk until smooth.
		Pour over cooked pasta or use as cheese fondue.
